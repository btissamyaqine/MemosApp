# the issue i face :
1. the api in mongoDB->i changed by 0.0.0.0/0
2. the cors: Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5000/posts' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
 - in package.json : i do "proxy":"http://localhost:5000"
 - install cors running the command npm i cors
 - then i go to index.js file and add
   - var cors = require('cors');
   - app.use(cors());
# for the part of Auth with Google
